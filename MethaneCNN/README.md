# Methane CNN

URAP Spring 2023

### Getting Data

Download and put video data in `MethaneCNN/data`, in subdirectories called `MethaneCNN/data/train` and `MethaneCNN/data/test`. Test should have 13 videos from Pad 1 and Train should have 18 videos from Pad 2.

WIP: Currently everything below the warning message in the notebook.

These videos can be found in the [GasVid](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JKEMtCGPSq2IqGk4uXZP9A6gr8fyJsGC?usp=sharing) shared GDrive folder.
