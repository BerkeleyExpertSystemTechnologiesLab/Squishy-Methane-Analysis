1,26-Oct-25,"Imported the numpy files generated from my laptop to a google colab. I was able to import and process them. I then made a basic CNN structure and tested them with Optuna for hyperparameter searching. The results were poor with 16% accuracy for my initial random parameters and then 21% accuracy for Optuna searched parameters (Including optimizer type, learning rate, momentum, batch size, hidden size). 
Next steps are:
1. To make the ML model multimodal and integrate the distance, ppm, wind speed, into the model. Looking at simple mixing in with the Fully Connected layer. 
2. Will also test cleaning the data a bit more, trying to remove clouds and making a dedicated background image for each mp4 and each class.
3. Simply generate more data. Both from the original gasvid dataset and from an altered gasvid dataset (Altered to break up CNN from learning just what gasvid looks like)"
2,28-Oct-25,"Modified the model to resemble VideoGasNet, added another convolutional block, but received even worse performance (14% accuracy). I need to double check that my synthetic dataset is being generate appropriately. Despite changing the background subtraction methods  to focus on 3 minute intervals I am still catching clouds in my processed data. I might hand make background for the subtraction method."
3,29-Oct-25,"Testing 3 minute background intervals and doubled the size of the dataset generated. Testing
Need to add print statements to track testing and validation accuracy during and after epochs to ensure that optuna is behaving as expected and is properly chasing maximum accuracy. 
After running a test with lr = 0.000011, optimizer = Adelita, Batch = 16, hidden = 91 I received a final test accuracy of 29% and Validation accuracy of 20%"
