These two directories were made to work together.

Multi-Class_Synthetic_Dataset directory contains all the code necessary to generate a dataset of 2-channel numpy arrays. 2-Channel refers to the "layers" in the image, for reference a standard RGB image has 3-channels, and a Greyscale image has 1 channel. 

By running the code inside Multi-Class_Synthetic_Dataset you will get 2-channel numpy arrays that can be fed into the models in Multi-Class_Quantification_Models.

These models are prototypes to experiment what techniques currently work best on the data. 

The Models are labeled with the higher numbers being the most recent experiments, however I have not removed any models that may have been improved upon, to go back and look at past experiments.
